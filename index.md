## Why Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Do you wonder why AWS? It all began with my intense fascination with cloud computing and the rising need in the labor market for cloud experts. Amazon Web Services has revolutionized the way we think about computing, storage, and
scalability.

## The Cloud Practitioner Certification Objectives

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam is intended for individuals who can effectively demonstrate overall knowledge of the AWS Cloud, independent of a specific job role. The exam validates a candidateâ€™s ability to complete the following tasks:

- Explain the value of the AWS Cloud.
- Understand and explain the AWS shared responsibility model.
- Understand security best practices.
- Understand AWS Cloud costs, economics, and billing practices.
- Describe and position the core AWS services, including compute, network, database, and storage services.
- Identify AWS services for common use cases.

## Outro

The world of AWS and cloud computing is filled with endless possibilities, and I can't wait to see where it takes you.
